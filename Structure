1 Introduction:

2 SOTA:
	Literature review
	Scientific Contribution

3 Methods:
	3.1 Dataset:
		Source
		Image size
		Variation
		Setting
		Preprocessing

	3.2 Model Details:
		3.2.1 DETR:
			Architecture Diagram
			Implementation
			Training Preprocessing
		
		3.2.2 YOLOv7:
			...
		
	3.3 Evaluation Metrics:
		how to evaluate models ( Precision-Recall-Curves and ROC-Curves )

4. Results:
	4.1 Qualitative Results:
		4.1.1 DETR:
			Loss Curve Figure
			Performance Figures with Precision-Recall-Curves and ROC-Curves (as descirbed in Evaluation Metrics )

		4.1.2 YOLOv7:

		Table representing Performance of both models


	4.2 Qualitative Results:
		Images with DETR
		Images with YOLOv7
		Images with both models

5 Discussion:
	Strenght and weakness of both models
	(keine Ahnung, sonst noch Ideen?)

6 Summary and Outlook:
	Summarize YOLOv7 and DETR
	Mention Limitations and any form of Bias
	Outlook for improvements
